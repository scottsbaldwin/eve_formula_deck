# Balance 3 Key Attitudes

Happiness and joy come from <br/>correctly balancing three attitudes:

* Toward self: _egolessness_
* Toward connections: _vulnerability_
* Toward others: _empathy_

---

## Attitude toward self: Egolessness

* 4 weeks ago I was really challenged with <br/>"do it my way" syndrome
* Why is it easier to tear down than to build up?
* Pride an arrogance are often found <br/>behind someone's back

^ "it’s funny because i have to speak at this conference in 3 weeks about egolessness, and it seems like the last 2 weeks have been challenging for me in that area"
^ It’s easier just to vent and tear town your teammates behind their backs, but only gives you temporary happiness. very temporary

^ egolessness antonyms: **arrogant, patronizing, overbearing, always right, "do it my way"**
^ vulnerability antonyms: _guarded, self-protecting, closed-off, defensive, resistant_
^ empathy antonyms: **narcissistic, cold, narrow-minded, callous, selfish, heartless**

## Attitude toward connections: Vulnerability

> "Treat [others] as if they were in serious trouble,<br/> and you will be right more than half the time."

* Connections are why we're here
* We must allow ourselves to really be seen
* Let go of who we think we should be,<br/> and be who we really are
* Have the courage to be imperfect

^ Eyring, https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord?lang=eng
^ Brené Brown, Power of Vulnerability, https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability, June 2010, Houston, 29MM views
^* where do you feel like you really belong?
^* those who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they are worthy of love and belonging
^* love with our whole hearts

---

## Attitude toward connections: Vulnerability

* Core of shame/fear, but also the birthplace of:<br/>joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love
* We can't numb feelings selectively
* If we numb sadness, we numb joy too!
* Treat ourselves kindly, then treat others kindly
* Believe: "I am enough"

---

## Attitude toward others: Empathy

* Perspective-taking
* Staying out of judgment
* Recognizing emotion in others
* Empathy means feeling with people

## Attitude toward others: Empathy

* "I'm stuck, it's dark, I'm overwhelmed!"
* Climb down with them and say, "Hey, I know what it's like down here and you're not alone."
* Don't say, "Well, at least..."
* Say, "I don't even know what to say right now, I'm just so glad you told me."

^* Sympathy says, "Ooh. It's bad down there."
^ Empathy requires me to reach deep inside and connect with something in myself that knows the feeling someone else is experiencing.
^ Empathic responses rarely begin with "at least..." Neither do they try to "silver-line" the situation.
^ Instead, they sound more like: "I don't even know what to say right now, I'm just so glad you told me."
^ Rarely can a response make something better. What makes it better is a connection.

^ Brené Brown, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw
^ Synonyms: compassionate, sensitive, gentle, tender, kind, merciful, loving, warm

# Create a "revolution of tenderness"

* Hope doesn't start with "us," it starts with one "you," then another "you," and another "you."
* When it turns into "us" then we have a revolution.
* "This is tenderness: <br/>being on the same level as the other."

^ "The more powerful you are, the more your actions will have an impact on people, the more responsible you are to act humbly. If you don't, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin the other."
^ Pope Francis on tenderness, See http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/26/525699847/in-surprise-ted-talk-pope-francis-asks-the-powerful-for-revolution-of-tenderness

#**Kind Ops**

Is there kindness you can do for someone **today**?

* Send that note to a friend you’ve been thinking of
* Give your child a hug, give your parents a hug
* Say "I love you" more
* Ask the homeless person their name, lift them up

#[fit]_Imagine_

^I'm going to be vulnerable today.

Imagine there's **no anger**
Or **pride** or **ego** too
People **caring** for each another
Like **brother and sister** do.

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace (yoo-hoo-oo-oo)

You may say I'm a dreamer.
But, I'm not the only one.
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one.
